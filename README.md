# DensityANDPolarizationINWater
The "density_polarization_water" code allows:

1) Extracting the dipole vector of individual water molecules from a trajectory file in GROMACS format and calculating the total polarization vector at a given time instant.

2) Plotting the spatial distribution of molecular dipoles in Cartesian coordinates, including a specific analysis of their distribution along the direction parallel to the total polarization vector and in the plane orthogonal to it. The code analyzes also the spatial distribution of sub-cell dipoles, calculated as the sum of the molecular dipoles within each individual sub-cell.

3) Compute the dielectric constant, isothermal compressibility, fourth-order polarization distribution Binder cumulant, and average density with the associated error obtained from block averaging.

4) Compute the intermediate scattering function, C(k,t), in a user-selected range of wavevectors k, for the fluctuations of the polarization parallel and orthogonal to the time-series averaged total polarization vector, the  polarization magnitude, and the particle number density.

5) Compute, in the same user-selected range of wavevectors k, the non-local susceptibility of polarization fluctuations parallel and orthogonal to the time-series averaged total polarization vector, the static structure factor of particles number density with respect to their center of mass, the non-local dielectric function parallel and orthogonal to the wavevector k, and the static correlation function between polarization fluctuations parallel to the time-series averaged total polarization vector and particles number density fluctuations, or the square of the polarization fluctuations orthogonal to time-series averaged total polarization vector.

The code is specifically designed for the TIP4P/Ice water model and a simulation box containing 1000 molecules; however, it can be adapted for different systems if required.

This code allows obtaining the results discussed in M.G. Izzo, J. Russo, G. Pastore, The interplay between liquidâ€“liquid and ferroelectric phase transitions in supercooled water, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 121 (47) e2412456121, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2412456121 (2024).
